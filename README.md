## About Me

I'm a software architect and full-stack developer based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. 🇨🇦🏴󠁣󠁡󠁡󠁢󠁿

## What I Do

I design and build software systems. The sort of systems that don't crash when they receive incorrect data, that don't need to be rebooted constantly and that don't run so slowly that the users think they've crashed. Systems that take data from any source - databases, files, networks, APIs - process it as quickly, efficiently and reliably as possible and output the results in whatever form the customer requires.

I've designed and written systems for banks, finance companies, energy companies, insurance syndicates, security companies and many others.

I use Continuous Integration and Deployment to automate every part of the process from building to unit testing to deployment and integration testing.

## Technologies I've Used

I started my career as an Electronic Engineer (I'm a [Chartered Engineer](https://www.engc.org.uk/ceng)) and I used to design PCBs, FPGAs and video hardware, but I quickly changed to designing and writing software.

I've used a LOT of different technologies in my career, depending on the problems I'm trying to solve because [languages are just tools](https://www.softwarepragmatism.com/programming-languages-they-re-just-a-bunch-of-tools).

The main languages I've used most recently are:

- Python
- C#
- ASP.NET
- C++

I've used these on:

- Windows
- Ubuntu Linux
- AWS Linux
- MacOS

And used these databases:

- MS SQL Server
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle
- Vertica

I've also recently used:

- AWS Lambda
- AWS API Gateway
- Various other AWS features!
- Terraform
- Django
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- bash
- JavaScript

## How I Can Help You
