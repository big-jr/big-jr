## About Me

I'm a software architect and full-stack developer based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. üá®üá¶üè¥Û†Å£Û†Å°Û†Å°Û†Å¢Û†Åø

## What I Do

I design and build software systems. Systems that don't crash when they receive incorrect data, that don't need to be rebooted constantly and that don't run so slowly that the users think they've crashed. Systems that take data from any source - databases, files, networks, APIs - process it as quickly, efficiently and reliably as possible and output the results in whatever form the customer requires.

I've designed and written systems for energy companies, railways, security companies, banks, finance companies, insurance syndicates and many others.

I use Continuous Integration and Deployment to automate every part of the process from building to unit testing to deployment and integration testing. I usually try to automate everything I can - it makes things faster, and it removes errors.

## Technologies I've Used

I started my career as an Electronic Engineer (I'm a [Chartered Engineer](https://www.engc.org.uk/ceng)) and I used to design PCBs, FPGAs and video hardware, but I quickly changed to designing and writing software.

I've used a LOT of different technologies in my career, depending on the problems I'm trying to solve because [languages are just tools](https://www.softwarepragmatism.com/programming-languages-they-re-just-a-bunch-of-tools).

The main languages I've used most recently are:

- Python
- C#
- ASP.NET
- C++

I've used these on:

- Windows
- Ubuntu Linux
- AWS Linux
- MacOS

And used these databases:

- MS SQL Server
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle
- Vertica

I've also recently used:

- AWS Lambda
- AWS API Gateway
- Various other AWS features!
- Terraform
- Django
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- bash
- JavaScript

## Open Source Software I've Written

### Randalyze

My main open source project is [Randalyze](https://pypi.org/project/randalyze/), a Python package that generates and analyzes random numbers that match those encountered in real life. The numbers are distributed according to Benford's Law; for more details, there's an article on my blog: [Are those numbers realistic or fake? Try using Benford's Law](https://www.softwarepragmatism.com/benfords-law)

### PrimeGenerators

My newest open source project is [primegenerators](https://pypi.org/project/primegenerators/), a Python package that generates prime numbers, checks whether given numbers are prime, and factorizes them.

### Witter

[Witter](https://pypi.org/project/witter/) lets you generate pseudo-random text in the style of an original file you provide. For example, if you want to generate text in the style of Shakespeare's sonnets, War and Peace, or any (preferably big) text document you have, it will come up with gems like:

*What acceptable audit canst thou O cruel, say I love thee with mine, compare thee to a summer's story tell Or from their physicians know. For if I should despair I should grow mad, And in mine own love's might O let my looks be then the eloquence, And dumb presagers of my silence cannot boast, I was not sick of any fear from thence.*

Nobody said it was going to make sense! What it DOES do though, is to demonstrate text parsing, stochastic methods, and some statistics.
