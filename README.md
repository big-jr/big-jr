## About Me

I'm a software architect and full-stack developer based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. 🇨🇦🏴󠁣󠁡󠁡󠁢󠁿

## What I Do

I design and build software systems. The sort of systems that don't crash when they receive incorrect data, that don't need to be rebooted constantly and that don't run so slowly that the users think they've crashed. Systems that take data from any source, process it as quickly, efficiently and reliably as possible and output the results in whatever form is required.

I use Continuous Integration and Deployment to automate every part of the process from building to unit testing to deployment and integration testing.

## Technologies I've Used

I started off as an Electronic Engineer (I'm a [Chartered Engineer](https://www.engc.org.uk/ceng)) and I used to design PCBs, FPGAs and video hardware, but I now design and write software.

I've used a LOT of technology in my career, depending on the problems I'm trying to solve because [languages are just tools](https://www.softwarepragmatism.com/programming-languages-they-re-just-a-bunch-of-tools).

The main languages I've used recently are:

- Python
- C#
- C++

I've used these on:

- Windows
- Ubuntu Linux
- AWS Linux

And used these databases:

- MS SQL Server
- PostgreSQL

I've also recently used:

- AWS Lambda
- AWS API Gateway
- Various other AWS features!
- Terraform
- bash
