I'm Jason Ross, a software architect and full-stack developer based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. This is my portfolio site for my professional activities and articles.

I design and build software systems. The sort of systems that don't crash when they receive incorrect data, that don't need to be rebooted constantly and that don't run so slowly that the users think they've crashed. Systems that take data from any source, process it as quickly, efficiently and reliably as possible and output the results in whatever form is required.

I use Continuous Integration and Deployment to automate every part of the process from building to unit testing to deployment and integration testing.

I have an engineering background and I'm a [Chartered Engineer](https://www.engc.org.uk/ceng) but I now design and write software mostly in C#, Python and C++ on both Windows and Linux, usually with SQL databases, although I've also developed with a few other languages.

My professional web site is [Software Pragmatism](https://www.softwarepragmatism.com/)

I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SoftwarePragmat)
